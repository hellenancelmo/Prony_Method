# The project

 * 1 - What is this project?
     
     This project was created to reconstruction waveforms and extract features for the classification step in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM).
    
 * 2 - Which software was used to develop and use this project?
     
     Matlab R2017b

# Codes

* 1 - Which database was used in these codes?
     
     COOLL - available in https://coolldataset.github.io/

Ps. The codes are formatted for this dataset but it can be used for other datasets.

# Files
* prony_rodriguez -> use the main_methods, estimates the characteristics by four different methods
* prony_iir -> use the main_prony_iir, calculates four types of feature sets by the iir filter-based prony method
* instantes_COOLL_100kHz.mat -> ON and OFF moments of curves in samples, download this file to simulate the codes
